Analytics companies develop the ability to support their decisions through analytic
reasoning using a variety of statistical and mathematical techniques. Thomas Devonport in his
book titled, "Competing on analytics: The new science of winning", claims that a significant
proportion of high-performance companies have high analytical skills among their personnel.
On the other hand, a recent study has also revealed that more than 59% of the organizations
do not have information required for decision-making. Learning "Data Analysis with R" not
only adds to existing analytics knowledge and methodology, but also equips with exposure
into latest analytics techniques including forecasting, social media analytics, text mining & so
on. It gives an opportunity to work on real time data from Twitter, Facebook & other social
networking sites.
