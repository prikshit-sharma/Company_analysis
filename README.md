# Company_analysis 
We have analysed the process of information retrieval from data and how this approach
differs for data analysis because of the associated challenges with it. It has been realized that
traditional methods cannot deliver while dealing with data analysis and therefore techniques
like clustering become more important which can help in making some sense out of the large
distributed data.
Data analysis is basically the first phase of data science in which user extract the useful
information from the insights in order to reach to the final solution. Machine learning is also
included in this to predict the loss and benefits, and python provide the various data analysis
tools and libraries so that user can easily perform the data analysis on business data.
